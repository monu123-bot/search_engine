<p>Welcome to the Search Engine based on the BM25 algorithm! This search engine is designed to help users find relevant coding questions from a search space of approximately 3000 questions. This document provides an overview of the search engine, its features, and instructions for running and using it effectively.</p>

## Overview
<p>
The Search Engine is built on top of the BM25 algorithm, which is a ranking function commonly used in information retrieval. It considers factors like term frequency, document length, and inverse document frequency to score the relevance of documents to a given search query.

The search space consists of approximately 3000 coding questions, which are indexed and stored in a structured format to enable efficient searching. The search engine provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to enter their search queries and obtain relevant results.</p>

## Features

<ul>

  <li>BM25 Algorithm: The search engine utilizes the BM25 algorithm to rank and retrieve the most relevant coding questions based on the user's search query.</li>
  <li>Query Expansion: The search engine performs query expansion to enhance search results by adding relevant terms to the original query.</li>
  <li>Ranking and Scoring: The search results are ranked based on their relevance scores computed using the BM25 algorithm. The higher the score, the more relevant the question is to the search query.</li>
  <li>Top-k Results: Users can specify the number of top-k results they want to retrieve for a given search query.</li>
  <li>Command-line Interface: The search engine provides a user-friendly command-line interface for entering search queries and obtaining results.</li>
</ul>
